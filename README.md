# Reference Firmware for Glowforge
This repository contains opensource firmware for Glowforge brand CNC lasers.

The Glowforge open source releases leave a lot to be desired.  Notably, they have not released a buildable firmware image. To date, the only truly useful code they have provided is for their kernel modules.

This project provides a reference Yocto board support package that will actually produce a usable firmware image.  While it is intended to be fully functional, it is for educational and experimental purposes only.

This project is not supported or endorsed by Glowforge.
